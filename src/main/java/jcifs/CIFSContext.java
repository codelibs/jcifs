 * Encapsulation of client context
 *
 *
 * A context holds the client configuration, shared services as well as the active credentials.
 *
 * Usually you will want to create one context per client configuration and then
 * multiple sub-contexts using different credentials (if necessary).
 *
 * {@link #withDefaultCredentials()}, {@link #withAnonymousCredentials()}, {@link #withCredentials(Credentials)}
 * allow to create such sub-contexts.
 *
 *
 * Implementors of this interface should extend {@link jcifs.context.BaseContext} or
 * {@link jcifs.context.CIFSContextWrapper} to get forward compatibility.
