/**
 * An Access Control Entry (ACE) is an element in a security descriptor
 * such as those associated with files and directories. The Windows OS
 * determines which users have the necessary permissions to access objects
 * based on these entries.
 * <p>
 * To fully understand the information exposed by this class a description
 * of the access check algorithm used by Windows is required. The following
 * is a basic description of the algorithm. For a more complete description
 * we recommend reading the section on Access Control in Keith Brown's
 * "The .NET Developer's Guide to Windows Security" (which is also
 * available online).
 * <p>
 * Direct ACEs are evaluated first in order. The SID of the user performing
 * the operation and the desired access bits are compared to the SID
 * and access mask of each ACE. If the SID matches, the allow/deny flags
 * and access mask are considered. If the ACE is a "deny"
 * ACE and <i>any</i> of the desired access bits match bits in the access
 * mask of the ACE, the whole access check fails. If the ACE is an "allow"
 * ACE and <i>all</i> of the bits in the desired access bits match bits in
 * the access mask of the ACE, the access check is successful. Otherwise,
 * more ACEs are evaluated until all desired access bits (combined)
 * are "allowed". If all of the desired access bits are not "allowed"
 * the then same process is repeated for inherited ACEs.
 * <p>
 * For example, if user <tt>WNET\alice</tt> tries to open a file
 * with desired access bits <tt>0x00000003</tt> (<tt>FILE_READ_DATA |
 * FILE_WRITE_DATA</tt>) and the target file has the following security
 * descriptor ACEs:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Allow WNET\alice     0x001200A9  Direct
 * Allow Administrators 0x001F01FF  Inherited
 * Allow SYSTEM         0x001F01FF  Inherited
 * </pre>
 *
 * the access check would fail because the direct ACE has an access mask
 * of <tt>0x001200A9</tt> which doesn't have the
 * <tt>FILE_WRITE_DATA</tt> bit on (bit <tt>0x00000002</tt>). Actually, this isn't quite correct. If
 * <tt>WNET\alice</tt> is in the local <tt>Administrators</tt> group the access check
 * will succeed because the inherited ACE allows local <tt>Administrators</tt>
 * both <tt>FILE_READ_DATA</tt> and <tt>FILE_WRITE_DATA</tt> access.
