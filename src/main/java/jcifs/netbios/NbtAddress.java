/**
 * This class represents a NetBIOS over TCP/IP address. Under normal
 * conditions, users of jCIFS need not be concerned with this class as
 * name resolution and session services are handled internally by the smb package.
 *
 * <p>
 * Applications can use the methods <code>getLocalHost</code>,
 * <code>getByName</code>, and
 * <code>getAllByAddress</code> to create a new NbtAddress instance. This
 * class is symmetric with {@link java.net.InetAddress}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>About NetBIOS:</b> The NetBIOS name
 * service is a dynamic distributed service that allows hosts to resolve
 * names by broadcasting a query, directing queries to a server such as
 * Samba or WINS. NetBIOS is currently the primary networking layer for
 * providing name service, datagram service, and session service to the
 * Microsoft Windows platform. A NetBIOS name can be 15 characters long
 * and hosts usually registers several names on the network. From a
 * Windows command prompt you can see
 * what names a host registers with the nbtstat command.

 * The hostname of this machine is <code>JMORRIS2</code>. It is
 * a member of the group(a.k.a workgroup and domain) <code>BILLING-NY</code>. To
 * obtain an {@link java.net.InetAddress} for a host one might do:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * InetAddress addr = NbtAddress.getByName("jmorris2").getInetAddress();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * From a UNIX platform with Samba installed you can perform similar
 * diagnostics using the <code>nmblookup</code> utility.
