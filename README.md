### This jcifs or jcifs-ng

jcifs-ng will be a proper choice for many users. 
There are a lot of SMB devices in the world.
Some of them only work with the old jcifs library.
If you want to support many SMB devices, CodeLibs jcifs library will be helpful.
For example, since [Fess](https://github.com/codelibs/fess) needs to support many SMB devices, it uses this library.
However, if you have only a specific SMB device, you should use jcifs-ng library.
